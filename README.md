STEP is a machine learning model able to predict the diffusion
properties of a pointwise level. This means that STEP produces a
prediction for every frame of an input trajectory, leveraging multiple
ML blocks to account for the different properties normal and anomalous
diffusion trajectories have. The model was originally developed for the
[Inferring pointwise diffusion properties of single trajectories with
deep learning](www.arxiv.org).

The repository is still under construction though. We will fill in the
tutorials and format the documentation after the initial submission. :)
