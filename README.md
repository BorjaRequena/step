STEP is a machine learning pipeline to study time-dependent diffusion
properties. STEP predicts the diffusion properties of input trajectories
at every time step, allowing us to see where changes in the diffusive
behaviour occur (if it changes).

The method was originally developed for the paper
[Inferring pointwise diffusion properties of single trajectories with
deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00410).

The repository is still under construction. We will provide the tutorials
and the trained models to reproduce the experimental results upon paper acceptance.
