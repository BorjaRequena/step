STEP is a machine learning pipeline to study time-dependent diffusion
properties. It predicts the desired properties of input trajectories at
every time step, allowing us to see where changes in the diffusive
behaviour occur (if there are any).

The method was originally developed for the paper [Inferring pointwise
diffusion properties of single trajectories with deep
learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00410). We provide a
[documented](https://borjarequena.github.io/step/) library and extensive
[tutorials](https://borjarequena.github.io/step/tutorials/index_tutorials.html)
to reproduce the reported results of our work.
