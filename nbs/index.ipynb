    "STEP is a machine learning pipeline to study time-dependent diffusion properties by extracting them at every time step of the input trajectories.\n",
    "This allows us to see where changes in the diffusive behaviour occur (if there are any).\n",
    "The method was originally developed for the paper \"[Inferring pointwise diffusion properties of single trajectories with deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00410)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Studying diffusive trajectories, we can extract meaningful parameters to understand their underlying physical and biological processes.\n",
    "However, quantifying the trajectories is a challenging task due to their stochastic nature and other associated technical drawbacks, such as the presence of noise in the acquisition.\n",
    "Furthermore, we often encounter changes in the motion properties through time, which adds on to the complexity.\n",
    "Typically, these changes are associated with interactions between the tracked particles (from animals in the wild to proteins in a cell) with other components in their environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, accurately characterizing these time-dependent properties of motion can provide us with deep insight about the physical systems that we are studying.\n",
    "With our work, we contribute to the community effort of studying diffusive processes with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, instigated by initiatives like the [AnDi Challenge](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26320-w).\n",
    "We propose STEP: a method to extract the diffusion properties of trajectories at every time step.\n",
    "This way, we can easily see any possible changes through time both sudden and continuous, without any prior assumption about the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide a [python library](https://github.com/BorjaRequena/step) with [extensive documentation](https://borjarequena.github.io/step/) to simulate time-dependent diffusive processes, train machine learning models to characterize them, and analyze their performance.\n",
    "Follow our [tutorials](https://borjarequena.github.io/step/tutorials/index_tutorials.html) to get familiar with our method, reproduce our results, and use STEP to analyze your experiments!\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {.callout-note}\n",
    "We use the [AnDi datasets library](https://andichallenge.github.io/andi_datasets/) to simulate the anomalous diffusion segments in the trajectories.\n",

    "# Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use our library, you will need a system with `python>=3.10`.\n",
    "Then, you can install STEP by first cloning our repository in your filesystem:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/BorjaRequena/step.git\n",
    "cd step\n",
    "pip install .\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will install all the necessary dependencies to make full use of the library.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train the machine learning models, we recommend using a GPU to take full advantage of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).\n",
    "A viable option is to use [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n",
    "There, you can use hardware accelerators (GPUs and TPUs) from the menu `Runtime>Change runtime type` and selecting your desired accelerator in the `Hardware accelerator` dropdown menu."
